# Blitz P2P Bridge - Tunnel TCP for p2p streams

This server provides a means for two, or more, app to communicate continuously over TCP connection.

Basically when app A write on channel the app B receive the data and vice versa of course.

The paper [Peer-to-Peer Communication Across Network Address Translators](http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/p2pnat/) inspired this project.
